These interpreters are programs that translate code into direct orders to a computer. Each programing language has its own <b>grammar</b>, that means a specific set of rules.

      <div class="concept-title"> 
              What is a variable in Python
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
            <p>
              We use variables in order to give names to values. Possible values are numbers or <b>strings</b>.
              There is a convention not to write variables with capital letters.
            </p>

        Strings in Python
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          A string is a sequence of characters surrounded by quotes.
          You can use double and single quotes → This makes indentation possible.<br>
          Using the “+” operator with strings means concatenation.
          You can index strings to select sub sequences from strings.<br>
          You can use the method <span class="code">find</span> to find the position of substrings.

      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
            We can assign the value <span class="code">299792458</span> to the variable <span class="code">speed_of_light_in_m/s</span> by writing code like this:
            </p>
          <p>
            <span class="code">speed_of_light_in_m/s = 299792458</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            We can even change the value of a variable by re-assigning it to a different value later.

        <p>

        <p>
          A function (also called ”procedures”) maps input to output. For example a function called <span class=”code”>square</span> takes a number as an input and produces its square as an output.

          In Python code functions are made using the keyword <span class=”code”>def</span> after that we put the <b>parameters</b> <span class=”code”>(a,b,c…)</span> in parenthesis.<br>
          Then we write down the instructions how to process the input and the <span class=”code”>return</span> assignment.<br>
          A function is used by writing its name followed by the values in parenthesis.

          Input validation prevents our site from being hacked.

Validation is import for all websites that employ some sort of dynamic content.<br>
          To prevent hackers from “breaking” forms and input boxes coders use <b>HTML escaping</b>. It replaces certain characters with other characters to prohibit malicious users from entering server-altering code.<br>
          Another reason for the importance of validation is user expirience. It makes it easier for the user to enter meaningful data.

          4 Common responsive design patterns:
        </div>   
        <div class="concept-description">
          <b>Column Drop</b> is probably the easiest. At its narrowest viewport elements are simply stacked one over another in a single column that occupies the entire viewport. With increasing viewport size the elements start being positioned next to each other in the same row creating new columns. Once the columns are all positioned in one horizontal row and hit the max-width, margin is added to both sides. 
          We code this using a flex-container and flex-wrap. Then we set up media-queries.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Mostly Fluid</b> is very similar to Column Drop but more grid-like with more columns fitting in different ways.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Layout Shifter</b> is probably the most responsive pattern. We use multiple containers and the order-attribute for more complex positioning. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Off Canvas:</b> Instead of stacking elements vertically it places not frequently used elements off screen. We use this .e.g. to hide the navigation menu on smaller screens. Typically the user has to touch the hamburger-icon to open the hidden content.

          For my additional learning I took the course on responsive images by Sam Dutton. It was truly awesome to use more professional tools like the JavaScript task runner Grunt. It was especially fun to control applications from the terminal and see how automation tools can change your entire workflow.
          Another interesting topic was making more extended use of Chrome Developer Tools connecting a mobile phone to it.
          I really got a better idea of making a good looking fast responsive website. And that does not always mean using high quality images. You can get awesome results using Unicode or Icon Fonts and making use of the full potential of CSS, which I am only beginning to understand.
          I am really looking forward to start the front-end-developer NanoDegree and acquire more profound knowledge.

            I wanted to get deeper into the design aspect of codingand looked for articles about responsive design on <a href="http://wwww.alistapart.com">alistapart.com</a>.I first found an <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design">article by Ethan Marcotte from 2010</a> where he predicts the great future importance of  Responsive Design. It was very interesting to hear him talk about Fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries as radical new technical ideas for responsive web design. He makes an interesting comparison between web design and architecture. He emphasizes the unpredictable character of the web that makes it difficult to find long lasting solutions, whereas in architecture traditionally creative decisions are made with a more static approach creating spaces that may last for centuries. Marcotte suggests using fluid grids as a more future proof solution. His approach is layout agnostic and adapts to any browser’s window width. It is a beautiful solution. Later it is suggested in the comments to add css transitions into the mix. I am keen on trying out all that stuff!!!
            <br>
            After that I read a much more recent <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/thinking-responsively-a-framework-for-future-learning">article on the same topic by Paul Robert Lloyd from last August</a>.Five years later responsiveness is an established design principle. A new way of thinking to guarantee the best user experience.
            Making content available to a large variety of users becomes the most important guideline.
            This becomes pretty clear in <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-design-principles/#priority-of-constituencies">W3C HTML Design Principles</a> and I would like to quote from there :
            <br>
            <br>
            <i>
              "In case of conflict, consider users over authors over implementors over specifiers over theoretical purity. In other words costs or difficulties to the user should be given more weight than costs to authors; which in turn should be given more weight than costs to implementors; which should be given more weight than costs to authors of the spec itself, which should be given more weight than those proposing changes for theoretical reasons alone. Of course, it is preferred to make things better for multiple constituencies at once".
            </i>
            <br>
            <br>
            Lloyd underlines the importance of a framework in order to assure quality and appropriateness of web development. He doesn´t  refer to a framework in the sense of software libraries or other abstractions concerned with executed code. He opts for a framework in form of design principles as defined by <a href="http://www.google.com/about/company/philosophy/">Google</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/design-principles">GOV.UK</a>. These guidelines are built on user empathy to assure a long term success of universal designs for erveryone regardless of age, ability, or status.<br> Another important point is to keep code simple and “share the toolbox” to favour a more collaborative interdisciplinary approach.
